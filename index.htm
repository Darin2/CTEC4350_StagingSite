        <h5>Project Summary</h5>
   			<p>For this project, Something Visionary will be creating a new revamped website for The G.U.L.F. There are various areas that could be enhanced as the website currently stands. The G.U.L.F has expanded its services and goals; however, the website does not accurately communicate those additions to its visitors.</p>

   			<p>This redesign will address all the current problems by:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Providing a smooth browsing experience with updated information about services to inform visitors and ultimately encourage recruitment</li>
     			<li>Employing Search Engine Optimization (SEO) marketing strategies to increase organic traffic to the website</li>
     			<li>Developing an enhanced brand identity to help with branding</li>
        </ol>
        <br>

   			<p>With everything being increasingly virtualized, a well-designed website is essential. Good web design serves as a guide for your visitors and sets the first impression. The aforementioned improvements will help The G.U.L.F stand out from competitors, build trust with audiences, and improve SEO ranking.</p>

   			<h5>Guidelines for Perception/Tone of the Website</h5>
   			<p>Since The G.U.L.F’s mission is to inspire and empower their audience, who are mainly young adults, it will be most effective to adopt a friendly and motivating tone of voice throughout the website. Showcasing the positive impact of The G.U.L.F will be a high priority.</p>
        <br>
<!--begin revision -->
   			<h5>Communication Strategy</h5>
   			<ul>Communication channels:
     			<li>Website</li>
     			<li>Social media</li>
     			<li>Team communication channels</li>
     			<li>Word of mouth</li>
   			</ul>
<!-- end revision -->
   			<h5>Communication goals</h5>
        <ul>
     			<li>Emphasize The G.U.L.F’s impact for participants and for the community</li>
     			<li>Highlight mutually beneficial relationship with partners</li>
        </ul>
        <br>

   			<h5>Intended Audience</h5>
   			 The G.U.L.F’s intended audience consists of the underserved and uncertain, along with entrepreneur-minded youth and young adults. Potential sponsors and supporters are also part of the intended audience.<br> When underserved, uncertain or entrepreneurship-minded youth interact with The G.U.L.F’s website, our goal is to communicate that The G.U.L.F offers a program that will resonate with them and ignite their inspiration and drive.<br> When potential partners interact with The G.U.L.F’s website, our goal is to showcase The G.U.L.F’s positive impact on the local community and inspire these potential partners to get involved with The G.U.L.F.<br>
   			<h5>Competitive Positioning</h5>
   			Although The G.U.L.F is not a for-profit entity, it still faces some small degree of competition for resources such as sponsorships and candidates. It could be beneficial to highlight the things that set The G.U.L.F apart from other similar entities, as long as this is done with a positive, friendly tone. Highlighting the “Diamond League” and the Youth Business Apprenticeship Program could be viable options in this area. <br>
   			<h5>Targeted Messaging</h5>
   			Each of the intended audiences will benefit from targeted messaging that is intended specifically for them. Separate email lists can be created to easily target each group. </p>

	  The wireframes shown in this document are designed to offer a low-fidelity mockup of how the website will be organized, and where each element will be located, similar to a blueprint. The website will respond differently based on the type of device being used to access it, so we have included both mobile and desktop versions for demonstration purposes.
